        My plans are to start my career in IT by becoming a qualified employee in this field. The course "JS From Zero to Hero" is a good start to achieve this goal. I believe that with the help of this course I will be able to master new knowledge and gain real work experience. I know that the course "JS From Zero to Hero" is recommended by specialists working in the IT field as one of the best for training. I also hope that after completing the training and successfully passing the tests, I can be useful to your company.
